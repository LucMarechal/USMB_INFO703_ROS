**Overview**
R.O.S. (Robot Operating System), a complete operating system dedicated to the development of robotic service applications. It is the most widely used open source framework for robotic software development.
This course gives an introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS1). The course should provide a good starting point for students to communicate with and control robots with hands-on practice.


**Objective**
This "ROS (Robot Operating System)" training will allow participants to know how to install and parameterize ROS, how to program a robot, how to use ROS navigation systems and robotic simulation environments:
- Understand the ROS architecture and acquire the necessary skills to design robotic applications
- Install AND parameterize ROS
- Learn how to program a robot
<ul>
    <li>ROS architecture: Master, nodes, topics, messages, services, parameters and actions</li>
    <li>Creating ROS packages: Structure, launch-​files</li>
    <li>ROS Python client library (rospy): Creating your own ROS Python programs</li>
    <li>Working with visualizations (RViz) and user interface tools (rqt)</li>
    <li>Control a mobile robot: in simulation with Turtlesim, in real life with TurtleBot3 Burger</li>
    <li>Vision: interfacing OpenCV with ROS
</ul>
